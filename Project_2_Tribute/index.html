            <h2>A Short Biography</h2>
            <p>Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was the foremost disciple of<a
                    href="https://vedanta.org/our-teachers/sri-ramakrishna/"> Sri Ramakrishna</a> and a world
                spokesperson for
                Vedanta. His lectures, letters and poems are published as <em>The Complete Works of Swami
                    Vivekananda</em>.
                Swamiji, as Vivekananda is affectionately known, believed it was best to teach <a
                    href="https://vedanta.org/what-is-vedanta/the-oneness-of-existence/">universal principles</a> rather
                than
                personalities. Therefore, his teaching and writing focus on Vedanta philosophy and not Sri Ramakrishna.
            </p>
            <p>Vivekananda represented Hinduism at the 1893 World’s Parliament of Religions convened during the World’s
                Columbian Exposition in Chicago. With his opening words, “Sisters and brothers of America”, Swamiji
                brought the
                crowd to its feet. Subsequently he was invited to speak all over America and Europe. In fact, most
                Vedanta
                Societies which were founded in America and Europe up through the 1930s can trace their origins directly
                to
                Vivekananda or the people who heard him speak from 1893 through 1900.</p>
            <p>After his first visit to the West, Swami Vivekananda went back to India and founded the <a
                    href="https://vedanta.org/the-ramakrishna-order/">Ramakrishna Order</a> at Belur outside of Kolkata
                in 1898.
                When he returned to the United States a few years later, he was accompanied by his brother monk Swami
                Turiyananda. Other brother disciples of Sri Ramrakrishna, Swamis Saradananda and Abhedananda, followed
                Swamiji
                and taught widely.</p>
            <p>Vivekananda was a man with a great spiritual presence and tremendous intellect who was a tireless teacher
                and
                writer. He wrote poems and hymns in Bengali, English and Sanskrit, some of which are sung daily in
                Vedanta
                centers worldwide. He was ahead of his time in encouraging women and Westerners to not only practice
                Vedanta,
                but to be leaders. Two examples are Sara Ellen Waldo who recorded and collected Swamiji’s talks at
                Thousand
                Island Park and Margaret Noble, later known as Sister Nivedita, who devoted her life not only to Vedanta
                but
                also to the education of Indian girls. <a
                    href="https://www.vedanta.com/store/master_as_I_saw_him.htm"><em>The
                        Master as I Saw Him</em></a> is her account of the years she knew Swamiji. Vivekananda initiated
                both
                women as a sannyasini and brahmacharini respectively, a radical act for the time.</p>
            <p>Vivekananda’s main teaching in the West, and in India for that matter, is Practical Vedanta. By this the
                Swami
                stressed that religion needs to be intensely practical and carried into all areas of our lives. The
                primary
                message of Vedanta is one of oneness and that our human purpose is to realize our divine nature. Through
                his
                teachings on the four yogas, the harmony of religions, divinity of the soul, and serving humanity as
                God,
                Vivekananda gave spiritual aspirants paths to that realization. The Swami also made <a
                    href="https://rkmath.org/vivekananda-contributions.aspx?pid=318">major contributions </a> to both
                world
                culture and Indian culture.</p>
